# SOAR_Research
Over summer of 2024, I researched on using Deep Learning models known as Neural Operators to predict weather attributes of New York, East Coast, and the United States. Following NVIDIA's success of FourCastNet, I implemented Fourier Neural Operators and U-Net to replicate similar results, and compare predictions with Neural Operators and Convolutional Neural Networks. The final poster was delivered at a summer symposium in front of more than 100 students, faculties, deans, and parents. 


Using the relative L2 loss function, both U-Net and FNO achieved 98%+ accuracy at predicting temperature 2m above the surface across the United States.
